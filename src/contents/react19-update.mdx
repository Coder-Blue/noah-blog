After a long developing canary version since April, 2024. React 19 was offically released on December 5th, 2024 by Meta team.

Powerful new features have been introduced almost two years after the release of React 18.3 that can make your codebase obsolete overnight.

## New `use` api function

A brand new `React Hook` that&#39;s quite unique because it can be called **conditionally** without throwing an error. It allows you to read the value of a **Context** or a **Promise**.

```js
const value = use(resources);
```

For example:

- The component:

```js
import { use } from "react";

function Message({ promiseForMessage }) {
  const message = use(promiseForMessage);

  return <div className="message">{message.text}</div>;
}
```

- Component call:

```js
import { Suspense } from "react";
import Message from "./Message";

function App() {
  const promiseForMessage = fetch(
    "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/message",
  ).then((res) => res.json());

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading</div>}>
      <Message promiseForMessage={promiseForMessage} />;
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

## Refreshed `refs`

Introduces new features for `refs`.

In practice, `refs` are now passed as **props** rather than having to use the React Hook `forwardRef`.

Example use case:

```js
function Button({ ref, children }) {
  return <button ref={ref}>{children}</button>;
}
```

## New `useOptimistic` hook

The `useOptimistic` Hook allows us to **update** the interface **before** the data is changed on the server, in order to **reduce** waiting time and increase the fluidity of requests.

For instance:

```js
import { useOptimistic, useState } from "react";

function Messages() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([
    {
      id: 4,
      content: "Hey",
      pending: false,
    },
  ]);

  const [optimisticMessages, newOptimisticMessage] = useOptimistic(
    messages,
    (state, newMessage) => [
      ...state,
      {
        id: `newMessage-${messages.length}`,
        content: newMessage,
        pending: true,
      },
    ],
  );

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        {optimisticMessages.map((message) => (
          <div
            key={message.id}
            style={{ background: message.pending ? "gray" : "transparent" }}
          >
            {message.content}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      <form
        action={async (data) => {
          const newMessage = data.get("content");
          newOptimisticMessage(newMessage);
          await sendNewMessageToBackend(newMessage);
        }}
      >
        <input type="text" name="content" placeholder="Your new message" />
        <button type="submit">Add my message</button>
      </form>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Meta Tags Supports

For example, here's how you can **customize meta tags with React 19**:

```js
function MainPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <title>Hello Main Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a website" />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Server Components

Already present in the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework, they are finally officially arriving in React 19!

Components which are loaded **by the client**, resulted in **long loading times**, doesn&#39;t suitable for a fast enterprise environment. React 19 has introduced **Server Components** as a solution.

In **Server Components**, the server itself loads the bundle and sends it ready for display to the user.

**Server Components** have several advantages:

1. The computing power used is that of the server, not the client's device, which improves the site's loading performance and thus its search engine ranking.

2. Server Components have **full access** to back-end resources (such as the file system). The data is secured because it doesn't pass through the client.

3. The client receives a **minimal** version of the bundle without the **dependencies** that were used to build the page.

The example:

```js
"use server";

export default async function articles() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/articles");

  const articles = res.json();

  return (
    <>
      {articles.map((article) => (
        <div key={article.id}>{article.title}</div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

But there are significant drawbacks:

1. Cannot use Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`.

2. Cannot access browser-integrated functionalities like **local storage**.

3. Some **Custom Hooks** cannot be used if they depend on browser functionalities (some dependencies, therefore, do not work in a Server Component).

## Server Actions

With React 19, it is now possible to use Server Actions. These allow us to execute a method **on the server**, thereby securing API calls and data.

Here&#39;s the form example with Server Actions:

```js
function FormComponent() {
  async function register(data) {
    "use server";
    const newUser = {
      pseudo: data.get("pseudo"),
      password: data.get("password"),
    };

    await fetch("...");
  }

  return (
    <form action={register}>
      <input name="pseudo" placeholder="Username" id="pseudo" />
      <input name="password" placeholder="Password" id="password" />
      <button type="submit">Create my account</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

A few things to note about Server Actions:

- The attribute used is `action` instead of `onSubmit`

- You need to specify `use server` in the method you call to execute it on the server

- The data is sent by React to the called method

## New hooks `useFormStatus()` and `useActionState()`

To use Server Actions, React 19 introduces two new Hooks: `useFormStatus()` and `useActionState()`.

Each of these Hooks allows us to modify our code based on the actions used.

### About `useFormStatus()`

The following way to use it:

```js
const { pending, data, method, action } = useFormStatus();
```

Here's what these different names correspond to:

- `pending` - To know the state of the form and whether it is being submitted (`true` if yes, `false` if no)

- `data` - To retrieve the transmitted data as an object

- `method` - To retrieve the HTTP method

- `action` - To execute a function passed by reference

Or **a simpilfied version**:

```js
const { status } = useFormStatus();
```

Example:

```js
import { useFormStatus } from "react";

function SubmitButton() {
  const status = useFormStatus();

  return (
    <button disabled={status.pending}>
      {status.pending ? "Loading..." : "Send"}
    </button>
  );
}

async function serverAction() {
  "use server";
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
}

export default function Form() {
  return (
    <form action={serverAction}>
      <SubmitButton />
    </form>
  );
}
```

It is thus very useful for modifying the interface based on form submissions, for example.

### About `useActionState()`

```js
const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(action, 0);
```

Here we have:

- `state` - Represents the initial state on the first render and the state updated by the **action** function passed as a parameter (you&#39;ll understand better in the example)

- `formAction` - A new action that can be used in the formAction attribute of a button

- `isPending` - To detect when an action is being performed or not (and thus to change the interface accordingly)

Finally, we pass to `useActionState`:

- `action` - the method we want to use when the form is submitted

- `0` - our initial state

Example:

```js
import { useActionState } from "react";

async function add(prevState, data) {
  return prevState + 1;
}

export default function Form() {
  const [state, formAction, isPending] = useActionState(add, 0);

  return (
    <form>
      {state}
      <button formAction={formAction}>Add</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## React Compiler

Although it didn&#39;t have an official release yet, but you can download the **test** version from Meta team instead:

```bash
npm i babel-plugin-react-compiler
```

And following the tutorial how to use the **React Compiler** on any React-based framework on their official documents.

It's promising on changing our way to optimize our React code. Like removing:

- `useMemo`

- `useCallback`

- `memo`

- ...

> ### Note
>
> Test version has some weird rendering issues because React community packages currently don&#39;t have support the magic that the **compiler** offers yet.
> Using with caution.

## Conclusion

React offer big updates which benefit us, however, Meta has a lot of work to do to satisfy the front-end developers.
