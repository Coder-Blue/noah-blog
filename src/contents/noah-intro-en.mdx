## My mindset & journey

Before becoming a programmer, I used to work as:

- Tour Guide

- English books translator

- Waiter

- Designer

- PC Technician

- Tarot Reader

My coding experience is on the home page, but to explain why I choosing Computer Science as my main major, I used to follow Language major instead, somehow in the past, my friends asked me to play video games with them, suddenly I did some research to make my PC could play the games, and then boom, I love everything about computer, I don't really know how either.

I never see myself as the best, I can only admit that I'm insecure of being left out. I only see myself as a sore loser and should always constantly torture myself to learn more, and become something greater.

I have an unstable mentallity, most of the time, I do everything randomly. Sometimes, I want to quit this major because of my weird superiority mentallity, but I never do it, this website is kind of a prove.

There&#39;s narcissistic part inside of me. I would do anything to achieve anything, even it can doubt my morallity code. Currently, I&#39;m trying to act better to avoid my weird narcissistic behaviour as I said for my jobs, and social life.

## My ambitions

Achieving the University of Toronto, Canada's Lester B. Pearson scholarship

Becoming a skilled senior software engineer

Joining Evan You&#39;s VoidZero to contribute the world's free open source software

Creating a revolutionary free open source framework
